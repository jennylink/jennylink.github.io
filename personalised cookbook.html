<h3>RESEARCH</h3> 
<p class="intro">The market of travel guides was shrinking over the last years, but got an upturn in 2015 when traveling and printing guides were rising again, thanks to new and innovative forms of travel guides (The Telegraph, 2016). Additionally, the tourist market is one of the world’s biggest and still growing markets. In 2014 London received 28.8 million overnight visits from overseas and domestic travellers (London & Partners, 2015).<br/>
Next to the number of potential customers, travel guides are facing digital competition a lot, as consumer are nowadays used to plan their travel online. However, there is still hope as “digital destination guides are not really born out, much like the plateau in fiction eBooks ...”. Digital guides are facing the same problem as printed ones. If they don’t display content in a different and inspiring way, people prefer to google (The Telegraph, 2016). In conclusion, travel guides need to become more innovative and offer customer an experience.<br/><br/>

<h3>INDIGENOUS VOICES</h3> 
<p class="intro">Nevertheless, a lot of well-known travel publisher are already developing new ideas and formats for their city guides. One of the main new changes is the incorporation of lifestyle insights and indigenous voices in every guide. Those extra insights offer an exclusive experience over your travel, you would maybe not get over the internet. Time Out, a weekly London magazine, produced city guides with a modern and stylish template, following the evolving travel publishing trends (The Telegraph, 2016).

<!-- IDEA -->	
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item" style="text-align: center">
<br/><br/>
<h3>IDEA</h3> 
<p class="intro">The idea was to create a mix between city guide and travel diary. The consumer will be the creator. During my first research, I mainly found empty notebooks as travel diaries. I knew about the Moleskine city notebooks, but they are designed as blank notebooks. I liked the idea of how this notebook grows with you, and therefore I developed it further and chose Moleskine Notebooks as my fictional publisher.<br/>
For this project I wanted to make travel more about experience, based on the thesis that people already know a lot about famous capitals. So my idea is to keep the content as simple as possible with a brief overview of ten famous spots and some necessary and inspiring information. The idea is to explore the city on your own and make it a memorable experience. Giving consumers the opportunity to become creators.

<!-- CONCEPTION -->	

<div class="flex-container">

<br/><br/>
<h3>CONCEPTION</h3> 
<p class="intro">
I tried to give the Travel Diary a younger and urban design, for the main audience between 15 and 24 years, but matched it with the well-known Moleskine design. An additional gimmick and original idea was to add some customizable space on the cover in the size of polaroid pictures (debossed rectangle on the cover). With this addition, the travel guide could be sold in shops like urban outfitters, next to polaroid cameras.
At the back of the book is a typical Moleskin “bag” with glue dots and stickers inside, helping to fill the book with memories. A special feature about the book is the binding. During my research in bookstores I recognised that books with a wire binding stand out in DIY, travel and stationery sections. Therefore, I choose a full Canadian wire binding, visible at the front, to attract more customers and separate from competitors.<br/>
To balance the lack of content, there is an app available. Most of the content will be in the app, as it is comfortable to carry a phone during city trips. The app is supposed to deal as a travel organizer, where people can plan activities of their journey, put them in a personalized calendar, choose sights and restaurants out of the integrated data base and safe them as personal favourites. There is also some basic information about the destinations provided. The design is supposed to be simple and elegant, with a clear overview.

<br/><br/>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3> 
<p class="intro">
To work out my idea provided opportunities to develop new features and a different way of publishing content for travel guides. The question is how far can this idea be built up and reproduced in different media? This is a new kind of city guide, but just a slightly change to travel diaries. It is not predictable if customers will miss the content or appreciate it as a memorable guide to keep your “London Memories” safe forever. At the end, it is also an experiment with content. Maybe this could be a way people want their content in future?!
